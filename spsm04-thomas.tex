\begin{abstract}
The security of Android depends on security updates for critical vulnerabilities being shipped to devices.
We define the FUM security metric to rank the performance of device manufacturers and network operators, based on their provision of updates and exposure to critical vulnerabilities.
Using a corpus of \daNumOSDevices\ devices we show that there is significant variability in the timely delivery of security updates across different device manufacturers and network operators.
This provides a comparison point for purchasers to determine which device manufacturers and network operators to use.
We argue that publishing metrics like this provides an important incentive to manufacturers and operators to ship security updates.
This is the first paper to quantify security update performance of device manufacturers and network operators.

\section{Introduction}

We show that Android devices do not receive security updates promptly when critical vulnerabilities\footnote{If malicious code exploits a critical vulnerability then it gains control of the device.} are publicly disclosed and hence, on average, \daMeanInsecurityPercNominal\ are exposed to known critical vulnerabilities.
We attempt to determine why by understanding the Android update process, evaluating different entities in the ecosystem and producing a scoring metric to compare different entities.

By producing the FUM scoring metric which compares different entities such as device manufacturers, network operators or specific device models, we can provide information that allows device purchasers to select devices with better security.
Currently, corporate and public sector buyers are encouraged to purchase secure devices, but we have found little concrete guidance on the specific makes and models providing the best security.
For example, CESG, which advises the UK government on how to secure its computer systems, recommends picking Android device models from device manufactures that are good at promptly shipping security updates, but it does not state which device manufacturers these are~\cite{CESG2013} though they have since certified one device model~\cite{CESG2015}.
We are also collaborating with a FTSE 100 company to help answer this question.
To address this, we developed a scoring system and provide numbers on the historic performance of device models in the \da\ project in~\S\ref{sec:security_scoring}.
We provide the answer to the question ``Which is the most secure Android provider I can buy from?'', showing that in general Nexus devices are better; further details are given in~\S\ref{sec:security_scoring:results}.

The Android update process is slow because its development is distributed among many parties and has a long multi-stage pipeline~\cite{HTC2013}.
The security of Android relies on many open source projects, including the Li\-nux kernel, Open\-SSL and Bouncy\-Castle, as well as Google, who build the core platform.
In addition, device manufacturers (we know of \daNumManufacturers\footnote{\label{foot:dadata}We computed this from the \da~\cite{Wagner2013} data, see \S\ref{sec:android_update_process}.}) and network operators (\daNumOperators\dafoot) may make further modifications before devices are shipped to customers.
Understanding this ecosystem is important because device manufacturers have introduced additional vulnerabilities in the past~\cite{Grace2012}.
The cause of the slow update process could be: upstream open source projects releasing patches slowly, Google including them slowly, manufacturers including them slowly, network operators shipping them slowly or customers not installing them.
We present a better understanding of both the ecosystem of Android development and associated vulnerabilities more fully in~\S\ref{sec:android_ecosystem}.

it is maybe secure if it is running a vulnerable version and but received an update which could have fixed the vulnerability if it contained a backported fix;
and it is secure if it is running a secure version.
}
\label{fig:proportioninsecure}
\end{figure}
By using data from \da~\cite{Wagner2013} we can examine the versions of Android running on user devices over time and through comparison with data on which versions of Android were vulnerable to different critical vulnerabilities~\cite{androidvulnerabilities.org} we can plot the exposure of Android devices to known critical vulnerabilities.
Figure~\ref{fig:proportioninsecure} uses data from \da\ (\S\ref{sec:da}) and the AndroidVulnerabilities.org (\avo) vulnerabilities database (\S\ref{sec:avo}) and shows that Android devices are often exposed to known security vulnerabilities (\S\ref{sec:androidvulnerability}).
One solution to this problem is regulation, and indeed there is ongoing legal action to force network operators to ship updates for security vulnerabilities~\cite{Soghoian2013}.\todolater{Check on the status of this legal action}
Many smartphones are sold on 12--24 month contracts, and yet our data shows many devices do not receive many security updates, with an overall average of \daUpdatesPerYearNominal\ per year. 
In contrast, Windows XP could be purchased for a one-off payment in October 2001 and received security updates monthly until April 2014.
An alternative to regulation is access to publicly available data.
Comparative data, which we provide in this paper, and will continue to publish on our companion website, provides an incentive to both device manufacturers and network operators to provide updates.

In summary, the contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item We quantify the Android update process, providing concrete numbers on the flow of updates and their latency~(\S\ref{sec:android_ecosystem}).
 \item We propose the FUM scoring metric to evaluate the security of different instances of a platform~(\S\ref{sec:security_scoring:method}).
 \item We measure the security of Android against our scoring metric and compare different device manufacturers, device models and network operators to allow device purchasers to differentiate between them based on security~(\S\ref{sec:security_scoring:results}).
\end{itemize}

We indicate the uncertainty in our results by presenting them $\pm$ one standard deviation and give results to 3~s.f., this occasionally results in `$\pm\, 0$' when the standard deviation is small.
\todolater{Do we want to use the 95 percentile instead}
We explore systematic errors in \S\ref{sec:representative}.

\section{Threat model}
\label{sec:threatmodel}

We assume the defender can deploy security controls at three levels: in an online marketplace, at app installation, and during app execution.
Here, we consider three attack vectors against Android handsets.

The \emph{installation} attack vector is through the installation of a malicious app on the device.
Android devices can install apps through marketplaces, email attachments, URLs and via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).
By default, many Android devices will only allow the installation of apps from Google Play, which uses Bouncer to automatically analyse apps, and quickly takes down apps that are reported as malicious.
However, alternative markets are also popular, particularly in countries where Google Play is not available.

The \emph{dynamic code loading} attack vector occurs when an existing app download and execute code at runtime.
The most direct method is to upload to a marketplace a seemingly innocent app that dynamically loads malicious code, either as additional davik bytecode, as a native library or by embedding an interpreter and executing received instructions.
Neither static nor dynamic analysis of this app will uncover any malicious code, since it does not exist in the app.
The marketplace can try to detect explicit use of dynamic code loading, however there are ways to dynamically load code which are hard to detect even on a platform such as iOS, which does not permit dynamic code loading.
For example, a Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) attack is relatively easy if the attacker creates an app with carefully crafted flaws~\cite{Wang2013a}.

The \emph{injection} attack vector occurs when the attacker injects malicious code directly into existing code already on the handset. 
For example, the addJavascriptInterface vulnerability (CVE-2012-6636) allows JavaScript running in an Android WebView to execute arbitrary code as the vulnerable app's user.
The fix for the addJavascriptInterface vulnerability breaks backwards compatibility and requires a two sided fix.
While the fix was released in December 2012, by \daGPAPISeventeenLaterDateMonth, \daGPAPISeventeenEarlierProportion\ of handsets connecting to Google Play were still vulnerable to this attack~\cite{Thomas2015a}.

The best place to prevent attacks is at runtime, since all three attack vectors can be prevented at this level. 
Unfortunately, as Figure~\ref{fig:proportioninsecure} shows, the sandbox for Android apps is weak, since on most devices there are known critical vulnerabilities in it.


\section{Critical vulnerabilities}\label{sec:avo}
We have used data on critical vulnerabilities in Android from AndroidVulnerabilities.org (\avo)~\cite{androidvulnerabilities.org}.
It contains information on the discovery and publication dates, the versions affected and which versions contained fixes.
It only contains critical vulnerabilities such as root vulnerabilities that did not require USB debugging to exploit.
If malicious code exploits a critical vulnerability then it gains control of the device.

Some critical vulnerabilities are not traditional kernel vulnerabilities, but are vulnerabilities in \emph{installation} in our threat model.
For example improper verification of signatures at installation time was discovered in February 2013~\cite{Forristal2013} and meant that applications could pretend to be signed with system keys and hence be granted system privileges.
On versions of Android below 4.1 malware could then use known system-to-root escalation mechanisms.
Regardless of version, this exposed an increased attack area and would also provide the ability for malware to control all user internet traffic (via VPNs), brick the phone, remove and install apps, steal user credentials and read the screen.
The different categories in which the vulnerabilities fall are shown in Table~\ref{tab:andvulns}, `signature' vulnerabilities are \emph{installation}, while kernel and system vulnerabilities are used with \emph{installation, dynamic code loading} and \emph{injection}.
\avoTabAndVulns

\avo\ currently contains \avoNumVulnerabilities\ vulnerabilities, of which \avoNumVulnAllAndroid\ affect all Android devices and \avoNumVulnSpecific\ are specific to particular devices or device manufacturers.

We use the \daNumVulnsUsed\ vulnerabilities shown in Table~\ref{tab:andvulns} in our analysis.
We have chosen these vulnerabilities to fit the attack vectors introduced in \S\ref{sec:threatmodel}.
These vulnerabilities affect all Android devices regardless of manufacturer, and as a result our selected vulnerabilities will dominate any security analysis of Android.
Hence, with our chosen set of vulnerabilities, our analysis represents a lower-bound on the vulnerability of devices in the \da\ data.


\section{Vulnerability of Android dev\-ices}\label{sec:androidvulnerability}
Combining the data on critical vulnerabilities and versions of Android allows us to plot Figure~\ref{fig:proportioninsecure}, initially all devices are \emph{maybe secure} (yellow) since \da\ does not have historical data prior to May 2011.
This means we cannot distinguish between devices which are running a version of Android which is known to be vulnerable from one which may have received a backported fix.
This demonstrates the importance of a longitudinal study: this type of analysis requires years of data.
Once \avovuln{zergRush} was discovered in October 2011 then most devices are recorded as \emph{insecure} (red) as they were exposed to that vulnerability.
The remaining devices were already running a version of Android which fixed the \avovuln{zergRush} vulnerability and are therefore marked as \emph{secure} (green).
From October 2011 until the discovery of \avovuln[APK_duplicate_file]{APK duplicate file} in February 2013 the graph shows progressive improvement as devices are upgraded.
This means more and more devices are marked as \emph{secure} because they are now running a secure version of Android, or marked as \emph{maybe secure} because they received an OS update that did not update to a known-good version of Android but which may still have included a backport of a fix, as the update was made available after the vulnerability was disclosed.
From February 2013 onwards regular discovery of critical vulnerabilities ensures that most devices are exposed to known critical vulnerabilities.
This gives us an average exposure to critical vulnerabilities of Android devices of \daMeanInsecurityPerc.


\section{Android Ecosystem}\label{sec:android_ecosystem}
There is a complex Android ecosystem that creates and distributes updates which fix vulnerabilities.
In this section we describe how the Android ecosystem functions and how Android versions are produced, as seen by the \da\ project and by analysing the Android source code and upstream projects.
We quantify the number of updates shipped by various entities in the ecosystem and the number of entities.

\label{tab:update_ecosystem}
\end{table}
To understand how vulnerabilities in Android are fixed we examine the Android update process, which we model in Figure~\ref{fig:update_ecosystem}.
There are five entities or groups that contribute towards Android updates: the network operators, the device manufacturers, the hardware developers, Google and the upstream open source projects.
Android builds on various open source projects, such as the Linux kernel, OpenSSL and BouncyCastle cryptography libraries.
Consequently Android can include any compatible versions of those projects, including those that fix security vulnerabilities.
Android also incorporates various drivers for different bits of hardware.
The Android platform is then built from these components by Google.
The code for each Android release or update is kept secret until after a binary release has been published.\footnote{\url{https://source.android.com/source/code-lines.html}}
Device manufacturers receive advanced access in order to prepare handsets.
The network operator may then make or request customisations and perform testing before shipping the update to the device.
Sometimes device manufactures ship updates directly to the user without involving the network operator.
Sometimes the device manufacturer and Google collaborate closely to make a particular phone, such as with Nexus devices and so Google ships directly to the device.
Sometimes device manufacturers incorporate upstream open source project releases directly, and sometimes incorrectly -- for example previous work has recorded evidence of broken nightly builds of sqlite in Android releases on some device models~\cite{Wagner2013}.

The numbers of devices (\daNumOSDevices), network operators (\daNumOperators) and device manufacturers (\daNumManufacturers) in Figure~\ref{fig:update_ecosystem} come from the \da\ data.
Device manufacturer and network operator counts were obtained by normalising the results reported by Android to \da\ of the device manufacturer and active network operator.
This normalisation is a manual task that involves removing invalid values (such as `manufacturer' or `airplane mode is on'), collating across company name changes (e.g.\ `lge' to `LG'), normalising punctuation, removing extra strings sometimes added such as (`(2g)' or `communications') and mapping some incorrectly placed model names back to their manufacturer.
This normalisation is not perfect and so these are overestimates on the \da\ data but they are likely still underestimates as there will be some device manufacturers and network operators that are not included in the \da\ data.
The representativeness of \da\ is discussed in \S\ref{sec:representative}.

In Figure~\ref{fig:update_ecosystem} the number of updates received by devices (\daNumFullVersions) is the number of different full version strings observed in \da.
The number of updates shipped by Google (\daNumSigOSVersions) is the number of Android versions reported in \da\ that affected more than \daSigVersionPerc\ of devices for more than \daSigVersionDays\ days.
This significance test is to remove spurious versions recorded in \da\ such as `5.2.0' in 2012 which had still not been released at time of writing.\todolater{Check if this has now been released}

We extracted data on the external projects used in Android and have included this and the scripts which generated it in AndroidVulnerabilities.org (\avo)~\cite{androidvulnerabilities.org}.
These scripts analysed the Android Open Source Project's source tree to examine the source code of each of the external projects to find the project version associated with each Android version tag on the repository.
There are \avoNumExternalProjects\ external open source projects in Android, contributing \avoTotalExternalLines\ lines of code.
We analysed the top \avoNumBigExternalProjects\ by lines of code (\avoBigExternalLinesOfCodePerc\ of the total) and were able to automatically extract the versions of those projects included in different versions of Android for \avoNumAnalysedExternalProjects\ of these (\avoAnalysedExternalLinesOfCodePerc\ of the total).
We found \avoBigExternalTotalVersions\ distinct versions, a median of \avoBigExternalMedianVersions\ and mean of \avoBigExternalMeanVersions\ versions per project.
Android rarely changes the version of external projects it includes.

%An analysis by Vidas et al.~\cite{Vidas2011} of the Android 2.1 to 2.2 update found that it took 11 months from when Google released 2.2 for the last device which they were investigating to get the update.
To compute the latency between upstream releases and the release of the first version of Android containing that release we scraped the release pages for those projects, to obtain the version numbers and release dates.
This allows us to compute the latency between an upstream project being released and it being included in Android, this is shown in Table~\ref{tab:update_ecosystem}.
The versions included in Android were about half a year old when the first version of Android containing it was released.


\section{Device Analyzer data}\label{sec:da}

In this analysis we use historical data collected by the \da\ project~\cite{Wagner2013}.
\da\ collects data\footnote{\url{https://deviceanalyzer.cl.cam.ac.uk/collected.html}} from study participants who install the Android app from Google Play.
Most study participants allow researchers around the world to access a subset of their device data, including the data presented here.

We extracted the build string and API version for each device each day.
The build string is a user-readable version string.
The API version is a positive integer that increases when new features are added to the API.
Consequently security (bug) fixes do not always result in a change in the API version.
Fortunately most (\daOSVersionPercValidLines) entries in these data have a build string of the form `x.y.z opaque\_marker' and so it is possible to extract the Android version number `x.y.z'.
On a large proportion of devices `opaque\_marker' is a well defined build number\footnote{\url{https://source.android.com/source/build-numbers.html}} however different device manufacturers use different schema.
Google provides API version distribution information but not the OS and build version information we need.
We verify that the \da\ data is representative in~\S\ref{sec:representative}.

\da\ has collected data from \daNumDevices\ devices with a total of \daDeviceDays\footnote{Here we are only counting devices and days for which we have valid OS version data.} device days.
The majority of devices only contribute data for a short period of time, however \daMonthsDevices\ devices have contributed data for more than \daMonths~months.


\input{security_scoring}


\section{Comparison with other data}\label{sec:representative}
Here we provide evidence that the \da\ data~\cite{Wagner2013} is representative for our purposes by comparing it with three other sources of data.
The \da\ data is collected from devices across the world where users have voluntarily installed the app.
We have obtained comparable data on 5\,290 devices from a multinational FTSE 100 company's mobile device management database, which includes company and employee owned devices, and from 5\,170\,000 matching User-Agent headers on all HTTP traffic for 30\% of Rwanda for a week.
\todo{citation for Rwanda dataset}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/dists}
\caption{Comparison between FTSE, User-Agent and the corresponding \da\ data, error bars indicate 95\% confidence intervals.}
\label{fig:dists}
\end{figure}
We used the data from the FTSE 100 company for a week in April 2015 and the User-Agent data was collected in February 2015. %between 2015-01-31 and 2015-02-12.% FTSE 2015-04-27
Figure~\ref{fig:dists} shows the proportion of devices running each Android OS version in the two comparison data sets and the comparable periods from \da.
The general pattern this shows is that in the FTSE data newer versions are more popular than in the \da\ data and that in the Rwanda data old versions are more popular than in the \da\ data.
Therefore the \da\ data on OS versions is bounded by these two data sets.
\todolater{Can we quantify this?}

Unfortunately, there is no ground truth of OS version information.
However, we have collated the API version information that Google has published most months since 2009.\footnote{\url{http://androidvulnerabilities.org/play/historicplaydashboard}}
While API versions are too coarse grained to use for security update detection they are closely related to OS versions.
If the \da\ data on API versions are similar to the Google data on API versions then the \da\ data on OS versions should be representative.
We compared the data from Google and from \da\ and they are similar.
We analysed the difference between the API version data from \da\ and Google Play, normalising for days since the API version was released.
This shows that the \da\ data systematically overestimates the prevalence of new API versions and underestimates the prevalence of old API versions.
This means that the OS version information from \da\ is likely to be overestimating the prevalence of new OS versions and hence our results are likely to be conservative.\todolater{Provide some numbers which quantify this}

\section{Related work}
We assume updates make security better, however the update process for apps, security fixes and OS upgrades also needs to be secure.
Unfortunately, package management systems designed to provide secure updates have been found to contain vulnerabilities~\cite{Cappos2008} and many software update systems fail to authenticate the connection between the device and the update server or do not authenticate the downloaded binaries~\cite{Bellissimo2006}.
Android does authenticate update binaries and Google Play downloads them over a secure connection~\cite{Viennot2014}.
In this paper we have analysed four critical vulnerabilities in the Android app update mechanism: APK unsigned shorts, APK unchecked name, APK duplicate file and Fake ID.
Other work has demonstrated complex and subtle errors exist in the Android app update process.
For example, the process can be exploited to allow apps to gain privilege through `Pileup' vulnerabilities by registering for new permissions before the update which creates that permission is installed~\cite{Xing2014}.

We used \da\ to record data on the OS versions of Android installed on devices.
Nappa et al.\ performed a similar analysis using WINE to record data on installed versions of Windows client programs and used cleaned NVD data rather than \avo\ for vulnerability data, they did not assign client applications scores~\cite{Nappa2015}.


We use User-Agent strings from Rwandan internet traffic to examine the version distribution of Android OS versions.
User-Agent strings have been used to investigate the timeliness of web browser updates, with at most 80\% of Firefox users running the most recent version~\cite{Frei2008}.
The same analysis was used to show that Chrome's use of silent updates seems to increase uptake of upgrades~\cite{Duebendorfer2010} with 97\% of users running the latest version within 3 weeks of release.
By way of comparison, Android's update process is manual.
The user is notified an update exists, but further action is required, including downloading the update and rebooting the phone to enable installation.
The phone must have sufficient charge to perform the update and the device itself is rendered inoperable during the update process, two factors that might prevent or delay the update process from taking place.
In our data we are unable to determine why a device is not updated. 
It is possible that many updates arrive at handsets, but are simply not installed.
Anecdotal evidence at least suggests that it is the lack of updates rather the lack of installation, which is the major problem at present and \S\ref{sec:security_scoring:results} supports this. Further work is required to tease these numbers apart.
Partly this is the result of the fact that an operating system update is being installed and so a reboot is required, but Chrome installs the new version side by side with the old one and switches the next time it is restarted.
The same technique would be more difficult on phones with limited storage space (as many cheap Android phones have barely enough space to install just the update) but is a plausible improvement for more high-end devices.
Google is deploying the same silent update technique through Google Play Services,\footnote{\href{http://lifehacker.com/why-google-play-services-are-now-more-important-than-an-975970197}{http://lifehacker.com/why-google-play-services-are-now-more-important-than-an-975970197}} which automatically installs updates for core Google components of Android, this also bypasses the device manufacturer and network operator.

As well as supplying security updates promptly, the impact of vulnerabilities can be reduced through security in depth.
In this regard, iOS provides additional safeguards beyond those used in Android, including a pre-distribution review, mandatory code-signing by the manufacturer, and (with the important exception of ROP-based attacks~\cite{Wang2013a}) the technical prohibition of dynamic code loading by an app.
These features, combined with mandatory access controls, has resulted in a lower level of malware affecting iOS when compared to Android~\cite{Felt2011}.

There are continuing efforts to reduce the impact of critical vulnerabilities, both in Android and elsewhere.
SE\-Android~\cite{Smalley2013}, which is included in Android from version 4.1~\cite{jelly-bean-release}, and fully enforcing from version 5.0~\cite{AndroidSecurity2014} claimed to prevent some root vulnerabilities and to reduce the impact of others.
Capability based enforcement systems such as Capsicum~\cite{Watson2010} substantially reduce the capabilities with which an exploit has to try and gain increased privilege and could be included in Linux\footnote{\url{https://github.com/google/capsicum-linux}} and hence Android.

Rather than fixing critical vulnerabilities, security can be obtained by detecting malicious apps and preventing their installation or execution.
Detection strategies include Risk\-Ranker, which classified 3\,281 out of 118\,318 apps (2.8\%) as risky of which 718 (22\%) were malware and 322 (10\%) were previously unknown malware, an infection rate of 0.6\% across multiple markets~\cite{Grace2012a}.
Droid\-Ranger also analysed apps finding 148 out of 182\,823 apps (0.08\%) to be malicious across multiple markets, of which 29 were previously unknown~\cite{Zhou2012a}.
A common technique used by attackers is to include malicious code in repackaged popular apps. 
An\-Darwin uses this insight to detect similar apps, and found 169 out of 265\,359 of all apps studied (0.06\%) were malicious clones~\cite{Crussell2013}.
Other approaches have made further use of malware dependency graphs~\cite{Lindorfer2014} or tried to extract further semantic information to avoid malware being able to avoid detection~\cite{Zhang2014} but simpler approaches based on extracting strings from the binaries can be more effective~\cite{Arp2014} in terms of false positives and false negatives.
There is a lack of ground truth data, a danger in training algorithms based on APK files that other algorithms have already found which might lead to new malware being missed and DroidChameleon showed that existing AntiVirus apps could be fooled by simple permutations of malicious APKs~\cite{Rastogi2013}.

The percentage of Android devices running the most recent version (\daUpdatednessPerc) is much less than the rate ($>90$\%) for Windows XP SP2 computers contacting the Microsoft update servers~\cite{Gkantsidis2006}.
A simple numerical comparison is unfair because only one major OS version was considered in the Microsoft analysis, and data was only collected from computers that contacted the update server, although this was the default.
More recent data demonstrates the difficulty of upgrading computers between major OS versions, with 27\% of Windows computers running Windows XP in July 2014,\footnote{\url{https://archive.today/PLGxn}} four months after Windows XP stopped receiving security updates.


\section{Conclusion}
We examined how the Android ecosystem results in different device models receiving different levels of security due to whether or not they get security updates.
We have defined the FUM score, which evaluates the security performance of companies and organisations in shipping security updates.
We have used this to compare different device models, device manufacturers and network operators and found that there are differences between them, which the discerning purchaser might use to influence their decision about which device model to buy from which device manufacturer and network operator.
We hope that this analysis will encourage device manufacturers and network operators to improve the support they provide for devices after sale.

\section*{Dataset}
Much of the raw and processed data and source code is available, excluding that which might identify individuals~\cite{Thomas2015e}.
Data from \da\ and \avo\ used in this paper is already available.
The Rwanda and FTSE data cannot be made available due to the terms they were obtained under.
